# Currency list with symbol place

Introduction
======
You can use this to arrange the currency symbols before or after the amount of money in PHP, JS, etc...

I am making this list because I need this for the future developments. Hopefully for everybody else it will be useful too. You can contribute if you desire, so we can expand the list much as possible.

You can donate too if you think we are doing an excellent work for your needs. The donations will be divided between the development contributors. Just mention in the description to which project you are sending the donation.
